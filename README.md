## Project: Design of Two Stages Operational Amplifier

**Description:**  
This project focuses on designing a two-stage operational amplifier to meet key parameters like DC gain, phase margin, and frequency response. The design was verified through hand calculations, MATLAB, and LTSpice to ensure optimal performance, stability, and compliance with specifications. It also includes frequency response, noise analysis, and linearity testing.
